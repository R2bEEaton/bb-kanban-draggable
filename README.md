# Bb-list-draggable
This is the read me for the draggable/sortable list plugin.

# Description
With this plugin you are able to order a list by dragging the different elements around in the browser.

## Features
* Reorder a list by dragging
* Higher priority on top

## Instructions
* Create a table with the following fields.
    * **Title**
    * **Order**

    ### Additional Notes
    * Rows with a higher Order will be at the top of the list.
    * Make sure that Order is a unique integer as the sorting depends on it.

## Demo


## Disclaimer
* Most of this plugin was forked from the column reordering capability of @ConorWebb96 's [Kanban plugin](https://github.com/ConorWebb96/bb-kanban-draggable/blob/main/src/components/ColumnsSort.svelte)
